### ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ **Important Update In Progress** ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§

We are actively working on a new edition of this booklet in response to changes in our audience and to address issues stemming from the outdated nature of the original guide.

- **Weeks 1 & 2**: Existing content remains useful. We are enhancing these sections with more in-depth material specific to the **Aptos Framework**.
- **Weeks 3 & 4**: Stay tuned! We will soon add comprehensive content covering **Sui Move** and unique features of the **Movement ecosystem**, including **MEVM**.

Welcome to *Building with Movement*! Over the course of this booklet, we will be addressing topics related to developing for the Movement blockchain.

This booklet was originally developed for a month-long hackathon, and so has content covering four weeks. While we think this pacing is nice, the book is concise enough to do in far less time and resumable enough to spread out over more time.

By the end of this book, you will have the skills to build for the Movement blockchain and the contextual awareness to understand its advantages.

If you are looking for in-depth documentation of Movement or the `movement` CLI please head to [docs.movementlabs.xyz](https://docs.movementlabs.xyz/).

> This book has an accompanying GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/movemntdev/movement-hack">here</a>. You can also navigate to it by clicking the <img src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/logos_page/GitHub-Mark.png" alt="GitHub" height="16" width="16"> icon on any page.

> If you run into any issues, please use our [Help Desk](https://movemnt.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/4) to file a bug report, request support, or search for additional documentation. We will attempt to provide timely support, prioritizing hackathon participants.
